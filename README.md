# FactionsPro

A modified plugin, better than ever. Being updated frequently. Edited by the VMPE development team. We update this plugin most of the time, features, bug fixes, and more. If you have any issues, or suggestions on what we should fix / add to this plugin, please open a new issue. We will make sure to read them. Thank you.

## What is this branch?
This branch is called configurations-v2. It's where we implement a more-customised Factions plugin for MCPE, bringing: Customising messages, making settings your own, and more. Soon, we plan on allowing you all to make your own commands, so for example, instead of /f aqs the main command, you could make it into /clans. Which we do plan on adding this in the near future of this plugin. Thanks for reading.

## NOTICE
## This branch could potentially be buggy, and unstabled. So do not expect it to work. If you have found any bugs or issues within this plugin, please open a new iissue on the issues tab. Thanks.

## Features
* All the features from the good 'ol' days are now back, and working with PMMP Latest APi's.

* /f map = Better than ever.

* Factions, more customised, and bigger than ever.

* Prefixes - You can configure the command prefixes in which you can use on every single command.

* F Values - You can use Faction money, balance, withdraw, donate, and more.

* /f say now works - It's better than ever, and /f say is finally working!

* Better Factions help page! Use /f help for the usage!

* /f claim now works as it should - We've fixed /f claim, and it's better than ever!

* /f overclaim now works as it should - In this version of FactionsPro, we've made it so you can Overclaim! This was also introduced in the Old Modded version of this plugin.

* Made configurations so much easier!

* You can now: Forcefully remove someone's power, and balance with a simple command.

* Aliases commands are now implemented and functionable! - Example, use /f make instead of /f create.

* Code revamp.

* Branches for different options!

* New Implementations / features! Working on super new exclusive features for free! No payments required!

* We try fixing bugs / glitches. We never give up like some developers out there do.

* Nice new features / implementations arriving here at FactionsPro almost all the time! - I said almost, not all the time! :P

* Good thing is - If a feature / implementation is broken, we either try and fix / patch it or we revert it - If there's no way of fixing that bug / glitch.

* Customiseable commands to make it your own along with: Messages, names, and more. That way, you can make the plugin just like your own. :P

* And still updating as we speak!

Thank you.


## Copyright Notice
If you're using this plugin, please do not edit the plugin to credit yourself only. If you do, we will mark it as copy right, and take down your server. What we mean by Not being able to edit the plugin, is for example: DOn't edit /f about to make it say "Author The LOOOL Team", as they never orinated it. What we did, is Edit the /f about to make us credit for something we did, but also credited the original author within the plugin (plugin.yml as well as the FactionCommands.php file), and made sure the original author got credited, as if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have what we got today. One of the best factions plugins out there in MCPE. What is allowed, is allowing yourself to have its own help page, and what's in configurations, is allowed. Thank you.


## What do we plan in the future of this plugin?
We do plan on adding more Configurations for the Factions plugin, ex: More to do with Help pages, and making it even more customiseable than it already is.
